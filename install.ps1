.SYNOPSIS
  Awesome CC Statusline installer for Windows (PowerShell).

.DESCRIPTION
  1. Copies the native Windows PowerShell renderer to ~/.claude/awesome-statusline.ps1.
  2. Patches settings.json -> statusLine (existing settings preserved + backup).
  3. Uses Claude Code's official statusLine.command contract: JSON on stdin,
     rendered status text on stdout.

.EXAMPLE
  ./install.ps1            # install
  ./install.ps1 l          # by abbreviation
  ./install.ps1 large      # by full name
#>

# ============================================================================
# HOW TO INSTALL — rules for the AI assistant running this.
# A user may ask the assistant to install from the GitHub URL without cloning
# the repo, so CLAUDE.md / the plugin command are NOT in context. These rules
# are duplicated here (the one file the assistant always reads) and MUST stay
# identical to CLAUDE.md and commands/statusline-setup.md in this repo.
#
# 1. You MUST resolve a size before installing. Never install without an
#    explicit size chosen by the user. "Auto" / auto-accept mode is NOT an
#    exception — the user is present and can answer; ask anyway.
#    Recommending `large` (below) is only a hint shown inside the menu; it must
#    NEVER become a silent default or let you skip the question. Always ask.
#
# 2. If the user already named a size (xs/s/m/l/xl or full name), use it; skip
#    the question.
#
# 3. Otherwise ASK with the AskUserQuestion tool, in TWO steps so all five
#    presets fit the tool's 4-option limit. Match the user's language.
#    Step 1 — question text (use exactly this, on one line):
#      EN: Which size would you like to install? (size examples on GitHub: https://github.com/AwesomeJun/CC-statusline)
#      KO: 어떤 크기로 설치할까요? (크기 예시는 GitHub에서 확인: https://github.com/AwesomeJun/CC-statusline)
#    Step 1 — four options, in EXACTLY this order (do NOT reorder). The
#    recommended option is ALWAYS large (option 1) — never substitute medium
#    or anything else as the recommendation:
#      1. large  (l)  (추천 / Recommended) — most info, good for most users / 추천 기본값
#      2. xlarge (xl) — largest, full detail            / 가장 크게, 전체 상세
#      3. medium (m)  — balanced layout                 / 균형 잡힌 레이아웃
#      4. small / xsmall — the two smallest, pick this to choose between them
#                                                       / 작은 두 가지 (고르면 한 번 더 선택)
#    Step 2 — ONLY if the user picked option 4, ask again:
#      EN: Which of the two smaller sizes?   KO: 작은 쪽 중 무엇으로 설치할까요?
#      1. small  (s)  — space-saving, key info           / 공간 절약, 주요 정보
#      2. xsmall (xs) — smallest, essentials only        / 가장 작게, 핵심만
#    If the user gives nothing / "recommended" / "default", use large.
#
# 4. Then install with the resolved size:
#      macOS / Linux:      bash install.sh <size>
#      Windows PowerShell: ./install.ps1 <size>
#
# 5. If "auto" mode blocks the install (it downloads code that runs on every
#    launch — declining to auto-approve that is correct), do NOT just stop:
#    still resolve the size, then have the user run it themselves so it proceeds:
#      macOS / Linux:  ! bash install.sh <size>
#      Windows:        ! irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AwesomeJun/CC-statusline/main/install.ps1 | iex
#    or have them leave auto mode (shift+tab) for the one install step.
#
# 6. Only a truly headless one-shot run (claude -p / hook / cron, no way to get
#    a reply) may default to large — and you must say that you did.
