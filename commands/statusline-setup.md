Install (or switch) the Awesome Statusline for the user.

## How to ask the size — MANDATORY

This section is **self-contained** — do not rely on the repo's `CLAUDE.md` being
loaded (it is *not* loaded when this command runs from the installed plugin in
another project). These rules are duplicated verbatim in `CLAUDE.md` and the
header comments of `install.sh` / `install.ps1`; keep all four identical.

1. You **MUST** resolve a size before installing. **Never install without an
   explicit size chosen by the user.** "Auto" / auto-accept mode is **NOT** an
   exception — the user is present and can answer; ask anyway. Recommending
   `large` (below) is only a hint shown inside the menu; it must **never** become
   a silent default or let you skip the question. Always ask.

2. If the user named a size in `$ARGUMENTS` (`xs`/`s`/`m`/`l`/`xl` or full name),
   use it and skip the question.

3. Otherwise **ask with the AskUserQuestion tool, in TWO steps** so all five
   presets fit the tool's 4-option limit. Match the user's language.

   **Step 1 — question text:**
   - EN: `Which size would you like to install? (size examples on GitHub: https://github.com/AwesomeJun/CC-statusline)`
   - KO: `어떤 크기로 설치할까요? (크기 예시는 GitHub에서 확인: https://github.com/AwesomeJun/CC-statusline)`

   **Step 1 — four options, in this order** (large is the recommended default):
   1. `xlarge` (xl) — largest, full detail / 가장 크게, 전체 상세
   2. `large` (l) — recommended default, most info / 추천 기본값, 대부분 정보
   3. `medium` (m) — balanced layout / 균형 잡힌 레이아웃
   4. `small` / `xsmall` — the two smallest; pick this to choose between them / 작은 두 가지 (고르면 한 번 더 선택)

   **Step 2 — ONLY if the user picked option 4**, ask again:
   - EN: `Which of the two smaller sizes?` · KO: `작은 쪽 중 무엇으로 설치할까요?`
   1. `small` (s) — space-saving, key info / 공간 절약, 주요 정보
   2. `xsmall` (xs) — smallest, essentials only / 가장 작게, 핵심만

   If the user gives nothing / "recommended" / "default", use `large`.

## Run the installer

Run the bundled installer for the user's platform with the resolved size.
Replace `<size>` with the chosen `xsmall`/`small`/`medium`/`large`/`xlarge`
(or the `xs`/`s`/`m`/`l`/`xl` abbreviation):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/install.sh" <size>
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT\install.ps1" <size>
```

If "auto" mode blocks the install (it fetches third-party code that runs on
every launch — declining to auto-approve is correct), don't just stop: still
resolve the size, then have the user run it themselves — `! bash install.sh
<size>` / `! irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AwesomeJun/CC-statusline/main/install.ps1 | iex`
— or leave auto mode (`shift+tab`) for the one install step. Only a truly
headless run (`claude -p`, hook, cron) may default to `large`, and you must say
you did.

The installer will:
- auto-install `jq` on macOS/Linux if needed,
- use a native PowerShell renderer on Windows, with no Git Bash or `jq` required,
- copy the chosen renderer to `~/.claude/awesome-statusline.*`,
- set `statusLine` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (backing up the previous file first).

After it finishes, confirm the `statusLine` entry was written and tell the user
to restart Claude Code to see the new statusline. The five sizes, smallest to
largest, are: `xsmall` (2 lines) · `small` (2 lines) · `medium` (4 lines) ·
`large` (5 lines) · `xlarge` (5 lines, full detail).
